# H24 Assignment

H24 Assignment is a web app which takes a url and displays information about the document, as per the assignment requirements detailed below.

Build the docker image

    docker build -t h24-assignment .

Run the server on port 8000

    docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 h24-assignment

## Assumptions

- Inaccessible links need to be tested
- The link checking is handled by the client to some degree, rather than putting this on the backend and implementing a queuing service like redis
- An ideal solution only uses the standard library

## Limitations

- Only works on server-side rendered pages, SPAs would require a web driver or JS interpereter
- No security or rate limiting

## TODO

- Improve Handling of Errors (e.g. rate limiting from external sites breaks assemble)
- Extend Test Coverage
- Clean up links - remove duplicates and non-url
- Handle encoding issue with titles (\&amp;)
- Handle missing protocol and subdomains in url submission

---

Submit the assignment

1. Create a public GitHub repository and commit code in it

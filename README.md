# H24 Assignment

Very work in progress, you can currently spin the server up with:

    go run main.go api.go services.go types.go

## Assumptions

- Inaccessible links need to be tested
- An ideal solution uses the standard library
- The link checking is handled by the client to some degree, rather than putting this on the backend and implementing a queuing service like redis

## Limitations

- Only works on server-side rendered pages, SPAs would require a web driver or JS interpereter
- No security or rate limiting

## TODO

- Implement Docker & CI
- Improve Handling of Errors (e.g. rate limiting from external sites breaks assemble)
- Extend Test Coverage
- Clean up links - remove duplicates and non-url
- Handle encoding issue with title (&amp;)
- Handle missing http:// at start of url and subdomains
